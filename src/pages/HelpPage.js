            Welcome to Set with Friends! This web app allows you to play Set,
            the popular real-time card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974 (
            <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)">
              Wikipedia
            </Link>
            ). The game is a race to find as many <em>sets</em>, or three-card
            triplets with a certain property, as possible from among the cards
            in the playing area. In this online variant, this is as simple as
            clicking on the three cards when you find a set, and the computer
            will handle all the details of dealing cards and keeping score.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            If you haven't played before, don't worry! We'll explain the rules
            below.
          </Typography>
          <Typography component="div" align="center" gutterBottom>
            <SetCard value="1120" />
            <SetCard value="2011" />
            <SetCard value="0202" />
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            Set is played with a special deck of 81 = 3×3×3×3 cards. You can see
            some examples of Set cards above. Each card has four features that
            distinguish it from the others: color, shape, shading, and number.
            For every feature, there are three variants (shown by the examples
            above):
          </Typography>
          <Typography component="div" variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            <ul>
              <li>Three colors: green, red, and purple.</li>
              <li>Three shapes: ovals, squiggles, and diamonds.</li>
              <li>Three shadings: striped, outlined, and filled.</li>
              <li>Three numbers: one, two, and three.</li>
            </ul>
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            A <em>set</em> is a combination of three cards such that for each of
            the four features, the variants of that feature expressed by the
            three cards are <b>either all the same or all different</b>. For
            example, the three cards shown above form a set, because each
            feature is expressed in all three variants between the cards. You
            can also have sets with some features different and others same. The
            three cards below are another example of a set.
          </Typography>
          <Typography component="div" align="center" gutterBottom>
            <SetCard value="2010" />
            <SetCard value="2212" />
            <SetCard value="2111" />
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            In this set, the three cards are identical in shading (outlined) and
            color (red), while being all different in number and shape. In
            general, any subset of features could be all the same among the
            three cards, with the rest of the features being all different. You
            can verify a couple more examples of sets below.
          </Typography>
          <Typography component="div" align="center" gutterBottom>
            <SetCard value="1221" />
            <SetCard value="1211" />
            <SetCard value="1201" />
          </Typography>
          <Typography component="div" align="center" gutterBottom>
            <SetCard value="0200" />
            <SetCard value="1101" />
            <SetCard value="2002" />
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            However, a triplet of cards needs to be correct in all four features
            to be a set. The three cards below do <b>not</b> form a set, due to
            their color. Two of the cards are red while the third is green, so
            the three colors are neither all the same, nor all different.
          </Typography>
          <Typography component="div" align="center" gutterBottom>
            <SetCard value="2010" />
            <SetCard value="1001" />
            <SetCard value="2022" />
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            You should practice these rules a few times until you've mastered
            them.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            To play Set, 12 cards are dealt from the deck. When a player finds a
            set, they take those three cards from the playing area, and three
            new cards are dealt to replace the ones that were taken. The game
            ends when the deck is empty and no more sets are available, and your
            score is the number of sets you've taken.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            In some rare occasions, there will not be any sets among the 12
            cards in the playing area. In these cases, the computer will
            automatically will deal out 3 extra cards (for a total of 15), and
            play will resume normally.
          </Typography>

            <b>
              That's all there is to the rules of Set, so head back and start
